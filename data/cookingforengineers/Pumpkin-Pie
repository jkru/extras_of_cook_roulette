			With Halloween just around the corner and Thanksgiving only a month away, I thought I'd share my recipe for the American tradition called pumpkin pie. Many recipes are fibrous, bland, and either too dry or too wet. Here's a recipe that produces a pumpkin pie that I think is just right.<span class="fullpost"><?if($fullpost==1){?><br />
<br />
The tradition of pumpkin pie may date back to the first Thankgiving feast in 1621 (or some say the second Thanksgiving feast). In either case, most likely milk, honey, and spices were poured inside the pumpkin itself. The first pies probably came out more like pudding than like the custard fillings that we use today. <br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1246_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1246_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='128' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Start by assembling ingredients: 3/4 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup whole milk, 1 can pumpkin (15 ounces), 1 cup dark brown sugar, 3 large eggs, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Fresh pumpkin can be used, but it must be cooked first (usually by cutting the pumpkin into pieces and baking in the oven). Its becoming increasingly difficult to find good pumpkins in supermarkets since the ones sold for carving dominate the shelves (or bins) and just aren't that good for eating. Save some time and trouble, buy the canned pumpkin. We'll cook the canned pumpkin briefly with the spices, so it'll be difficult to taste or smell any difference between the canned pumpkin and the fresh for this pie.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1245_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1245_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='218' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Prepare a 9-inch pie crust or defrost a frozen pie crust. Using a fork, punch holes into the dough so it won't rise while prebaking. If using pie weights, this step is unnecessary. Prebake the pie crust according to directions or at 400&#176;F for about 10 minutes.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1247_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1247_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='232' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Meanwhile, whisk pumpkin and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt) together over medium heat in a medium sauce pan. When the pumpkin begins to cook, whisk in the brown sugar.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1248_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1248_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='207' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Once the mixture is fully blended, scrape the sides of the saucepan down and whisk again.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1249_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1249_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='234' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Add milk and cream and continue to whisk.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1250_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1250_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='250' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Once the mixture begins to bubble and splutter, remove from heat.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1251_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1251_crop.jpg'  width='212' height='320' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Place the three eggs into a blender.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1252_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1252_crop.jpg'  width='165' height='320' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Blend the eggs to form a nice creamy consistency (about two seconds).<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1254_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1254_crop.jpg'  width='214' height='320' class='left' alt='' /></a>
While blending on low speed, pour the pumpkin pie filling through the feeder hole in the blender cap. This will help break down any fibrous or tough parts of pumpkin creating a smooth filling.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1255_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1255_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='239' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Pour the pumpkin pie filling into the prebaked crust. If you used a deep dish pie crust, this should fit perfectly. I used a "normal" pie crust, so there was about a cup of filling left over, which can be made into pumpkin custards by filling ramekins. Bake at 400&#176;F for 25 minutes or until center of pie is jiggly when pie is rotated gently.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_1261_crop.jpg'><img itemprop="photo" border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_1261_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='201' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Remove from heat and let cool on a cooling rack for at least one hour. The center will fully set without over cooking the outer edges by removing the pie early. Refrigerate and serve cold, warmed up, or at room temperature.<?}?></span><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br />

Also, wanted to mention that I think your blog is great, and please keep up the awesome work on it. Beyond just the dialog, I really like how you post your ingredients list at the end in sub-process format.<br />

					<div class="commentbody">I had my first thanksgiving in the States last year - I spent it with an American family who was incredibly hospitable. It was a fantastic experience, one I will remember forever!<br />
<br />
That day, I fell in love with pumpkin pie and vowed to find a recipe. Of course I never would really have done it, but now that it's come up on your site I've printed it and I think I'll make it next week in order to reminisce about my time in the States, and to share this tradition with some of my Australian friends.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Another tradition is to serve the pumpkin pie slices with a large dollop of freshly whipped cream. Often, the whipped cream is spiked with a little (or a lot) of brandy.<br />
<br />
Just whip one cup of heavy cream until frothy. Add 2 Tbs. sugar and 2 Tbs. brandy and whip until stiff peaks. Scoop out a plop ontop or next to each slice of pumpkin pie.</div>

<br />
The family I was with didn't use fresh whipped cream, but had two brands of frozen whipped cream. They debated over which one they liked best, so they showed me both. Trouble was that they had forgotten to take either one out of the freezer.<br />
<br />
The result: my pumpkin pie was served with two slices of frozen whipped cream, with the onlookers anxiously waiting to see not only whether or not I would like the pie, but whose brand of frozen whipped cream I preferred!</div>

					<div class="commentbody">re: condensed milk<br />
<br />
Using sweetened condensed milk would probably work. But the consistency will most likely be different. Condensed milk contains a huge amount of sugar, so you'll need to adjust the sugar in the rest of the recipe. Besides the sugar, condensed milk is just evaporated milk, quite a bit different from cream.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">re: prebaking the crust<br />
<br />
If you don't prebake it, then the pie crust might be soggy after baking a pumpkin pie in it. It's probably more up to personal choice, but I prefer my crusts to have a little crispness to them. The extra ten minutes during blind baking shouldn't burn the crust.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div>

<br />
Condensed milk is usually only available sweetened. This is not the product that you want. It is made by cooking sweetened milk down to a thick liquid and as such usually has a cooked dairy taste as well as an overwhelming sweetness. For this recipe, stick with cream.</div>

A. Pumpkin pi.<br />

Tee hee!<br />

Anyways, for those willing to do a bit more work, try making pumpkin pie using Hokaido pumpkin. Roast it, puree it and let it drain a considerable bit before using like normal canned pumpkin.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I was curious to try this recipe, as it was very similar to my recipe (which originated as the recipe on the back of Libby's canned pumpkin goo) but had a much different preparation.<br />
<br />
So I just had a very tasty bakeoff, making one of my pies and one of these pies with my spice loadout.<br />
<br />
I mayyy have overcooked this recipe's pie by a few minutes (yay for old ovens i'm not used to yet) but it was not ruined. <br />
<br />
I was hardput to put my finger on exactly what the differences in taste and texture were, they were pretty close. So I will most likely stick to my version, as canned pumpkin isn't fibrous enough to warrant a full blender treatment, and the pre-cooking didn't seem to do much but add to the complexity. I'll have to experiment more with the whole milk/cream vs condensed milk thing a bit more, though. <br />
<br />
Dark brown sugar goooooood. All the other recipes I've stumbled across call for plain white sugar, which makes such an inferior pie! Thumbs up on the dark brown sugar  ;) <br />

<br />
1) Pie pumpkins ARE available in our area (SW ontario), so I used these with all three pies.  I peeled &amp; seeded the pumpkin, chopped into chunks, then steamed the pieces.  I assembled the pie in a food processor.  I like using the fresh pumpkin as it has a hetrogenous consistancy.<br />
<br />
2) I didn't use any dairy - my 1 year old boy can't have any milk protein - so I made them with soy milk.  Tasted pretty good.</div>

Good catch! I posted this article over a year ago and didn't realize my error until you pointed it out. In the United States, canned pumpkin is usually sold in cans of 15 ounces (weight) or 29 ounces (weight). As pointed out earlier a 15 ounce can is about 1.75 cups instead of 2 cups.<br />

					<div class="commentbody">1- No matter what kind of pie you are making, <b>always brush the bottom crust with melted butter</b>. 2 T should do it. You never need to pre-bake if you follow this step. For better flavor, use unsalted butter.<br />
<br />
2-Before placing pie in the oven, <b>cover the crimped crust with a strip of aluminum foil</b>. For a 9" diameter pie and 12" wide foil, you will need 3 strips, each about 2" wide. Remove the foil for the last 20-25 minutes of baking time to let the crust brown, not burn. <br />
<br />
3-<b>Evaporated milk</b>, not condensed, works just as well as heavy cream. 1/2 cup, evaporated milk has 8 g of fat but heavy cream has 44 g. (whole milk has 4 g).<br />

<br />
I followed this recipe to a T<br />
In England where I come from there isn't  a tradition for pumpkin pie. <br />
Where I am currently working in Russia, people give away the most incredible orange pumkins, as no one really wants to use them.<br />
<br />
when i followed the recipe the only thing i decided to change was the crust. i used a typical short pastry 500g flour to 225 butter and a dash of egg yolk and cold water.<br />
<br />
I prebaked te crust to a nice golden brown and then added the filling.<br />
Baked for 30 mins as sugessted.<br />
PERFECT.<br />
My only problem with the first test was not baking the pie crust enough. it came out a little soggy and the only way round that is to bake it to a nice crisp texture.<br />
Thanks once again for a great recipe and  a great technique.<br />

I've never had a problem with the eggs curdling in this recipe because to prevent splatter, the pumpkin cream mixture is poured into the running blender at a relatively slow rate. The eggs heat up evenly and gradually as they are blended together with the pumpkin mixture. It would be another story entirely if the hot pumpkin mixture was in the blender and the eggs were added...</div>

For those who like your pie a bit "nippier", try this.  My mother always made her pumpkin pies by using 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup light molasses (instead of 3/4 cup sugar) and putting in a bit more spice than the traditional recipe.  She used cinn, nutmeg, gr. cloves, ginger, and allspice.  With everything but cinn, you need to be careful and just put in 1/4 teaspoon of each to start.  Then if it seems too bland, you can add a tiny bit more.  The molasses will make the pie a deeper, richer color.</div>

Even <b>if</b> the temperatures were exactly equal between one oven and another, air currents, etc would affect how long your pie bakes.  Therefore once you start using your oven to make particular dishes just jot a note on your recipe of the temperature setting used and total cooking time and you will eventually have a good set of data pertinent to each of those things you like to cook and can use that with new, but similar recipes to judge cooking times in your oven.  <br />
<br />
Of course, you will have your best data gathered about the time you remodel and change ovens at which point you will have to start again.</div>

And all that sugar and spice is strong enough to cover almost anything anyway.<br />
We don't get canned pumpkin here, but its pretty easy to cook. Just steam, microwave it (no water in a closed container) or bake it - otherwise it will be watery. Then mash or otherwise process until smooth. Pumpkin and hard yellow squash (eg butternut) can all be used, but some varieties are better than others.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">The best milk "substitute I have ever tried in pumpkin pie was cashew milk.  You simply soak the cashews in water overnight (raw, not roasted and NOT salted).  Then pour the mix in the blender.  You can adjust the liquid for thicker or thinner consistensies, but start with the least water possible so you are almost making a cashew butter.  I like a bit of vanilla added to it.  This made a very light and delicious pie using arrowroot flour in place of eggs, but it is alot thinner so this pie must be pre-coooked and then must cool for a couple of hours in the refrigerator before eating.  The thickened portion of pureed coconut (from a can) makes a great whipped topping for the pie.  It is a very satisfying alternatives for those with dairy or egg allergies.  (Alternately, coconut milk can be added in place of milk as well, but I like the cashew with coconut topping better).</div>

Fresh pumpkin can be drier or wetter than the canned type. If it seemed too watery, then it probably needed to be at least partially drained.<br />

When measuring brown sugar by volume, it should always be packed. It is not possible to consistently measure unpacked brown sugar by volume. Either use the mass measurement with a scale or use a spoon (or a measuring cup one size smaller) to pack it down tightly.</div>

In the Unites States, cream from cow's milk is sold under different names based upon it's fat percentage. Heavy cream (also marketed as heavy whipping cream) has more than 36% fat. In the UK, this would be somewhere between regular whipping cream and double cream. In Italy, I don't know - but since this recipe doesn't involve actually whipping the cream into "whipped cream" the fat percentage is less of a worry and more flexible. You should be able to just use whatever regular <i>panna</i> is available.</div>

The flavor is more intense than the brown sugar, there is also a slight concern over liquid content for the conversion.  Grade B syrup is not a quality grade, it is instead a color grade as follows: Grade A light, medium, dark amber, then grade B, then grade C.  Grade B has a much nicer taste, Grade C is too strong and is mostly used for commecial flavorings.  If you can't find Grade B, Grade A Dark will work, but add more (watch the liquid content).<br />

					<div class="commentbody">1) make your own brown sugar by simply adding blackstrap molasses to white sugar; blackstrap molasses (unsulphered) is what is removed from the cane sugar to make white granulated sugar - so, just put it back! Use a tablespoonful to a cup of white sugar for light brown sugar and 2 tablespoonfuls for dark brown sugar.  Use a small mixing bowl and a fork.  Alternatively, add the molasses to the liquid ingredients called for in the recipe, and use the same measure of white sugar as the recipe called for as brown sugar. How easy is that!  (And cheap in comparison to purchasing brown sugar!) There is no difference in taste, texture, or cooking quality.<br />
2) I started substituting whole milk for evaporated milk when I realized the cost difference (about $2.50 a gallon for whole milk versus about $16.00 in an equivalent amount of evaporated milk - you can buy a whole gallon of milk for about what two cans of evaporated milk costs!).  The can said that you could substitute evaporated milk cup-for-cup in a recipe calling for whole milk.  My recipe called for evaporated milk to start with, so I simply reversed it and used whole milk.  It's great.  No difference in texture or cooking time.  There is a big difference in flavor and cost, though, and both are just fine with me!</div>

I will try to add some heavy cream (which I make by using the Bell Creamer).  One other way with which I am going to experiment is to add a little bit of flour as is done when making homemade puddings and which is also used in cheesecakes.  Has anyone tried the addition of flour to a pumpkin pie filling to improve its "weight". or "body"?  I'll report my results soon.</div>

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>graham-cracker crust</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">Personal opinion: a graham-cracker crust belongs under a really heavy pie like a chocolate New York-style cheesecake, or a dense chocolate torte, a filling which the hard, dense, graham-flavored crust won't overpower.  Even then, store bought ones are really pitiful.  If you need a ready-made type of pie crust for medium to heavy fillings, try a recommendation from America's Test Kitchen: use animal crackers with a bit of unsalted butter.  Grind the crackers to a meal using a blender, food processor, rolling pin, whatever... then blend in just enough semi-melted butter to sort of hold it together when a spoonful is pressed into a ball.  At that stage, firmly pat it into the pie dish, then pour in or layer in the filling.<br />
<br />
Regarding homemade pie shells:  Too easy, and so very delicious, once you know what you're doing.  Get someone to come over and step you through it.  The trick is cutting in the first measure of shortening.  Using a pastry cutter, work the first measure into the flour really, really, well.  Just keep cutting.  The white flour will almost take on a yellow corn meal hue and texture.  When cutting in the second measure, work it until you still have some visible pieces of shortening - about the size of split peas to green peas.  And lastly, add enough water to form the mass into a ball.  Start with 4 tablespoons, stir it around with a fork, add a little more if needed.  Always allow enough time beforehand to let the ball of dough sit in the refrigerator for an hour or two before rolling.  This allows the shortening and water to fully penetrate the flour.</div>

I'm surprised the recipes didn't work and you had to throw them out. Butter's density is almost the same as water (a little [about 9%] lighter - closer to that of ice) so you would have been pretty close. 4 oz (weight) of butter would be about 1/2 cup + 1 or 2 tablespoons.<br />
<br />
There is no easy way to convert fluid vs. solid ounces because the densities of ingredients are all different. The only easy one is water - 8 oz fluid (a US cup) is 8 oz weight.</div>

you can brush the unbaked crust with egg white - that can help keep the crust from getting ' soggy' - brush it on, then bake.<br />
<br />
if the filling is too watery, it will soak into the crust no-matter-what - but typically the egg wash helps most while the pie is still 'fresh' - i.e. after some hours any free liquid will soak into the crust anyway.</div>

Normally, you can double the filling and just divide - but since your equipment cannot accommodate this, I would say you should simply make the filling twice - the extra time spent should not be significant as you don't have to clean up between fillings.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I have noticed that it seems some posters are using the terms "evaporated milk" and "condensed milk" interchangably and or without making a distinction between the two.  <br />
<br />
Although evaporated milk could be described as condensed, and in terms of the English language be correct - the products sold on the store shelves in the USA are of significant difference when cooking.<br />
<br />
The product labeled "evaporated milk" is the equivalent of double strength milk or milk with 1/2 its volume in water removed.  A can of "evaporated milk" reconstituted with an equal amount of water would meet the legal requirements for whole milk of the same volume. It's not likely to taste the same however.<br />
<br />
The product labeled "condensed milk" is a concentrated milk product with a large amount of sugar added into it.  If this product is cooked straight from the can it makes a candy much like a soft gooey praline, just to give an idea of how high a proportion of sugar is in this product.<br />
<br />
The two products are not used interchangably.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">We made this recipe while living in New Zealand and decided that it was far preferable to any pumpkin pie we had growing up in the US. We attribute this to the awesome NZ cooking pumpkins. When we went to make this back in the US, we were chagrined that we wouldn't be able to find NZ pumpkin.<br />
<br />
But then we found japanese kabocha squash at our local asian grocer. It turns out this is literally identical to the NZ pumpkin we used to buy. This squash is sweeter, denser, less fibrous and all around more awesome than even the butternut squash.</div>

<br />
There are some pretty lame pumpkin pies out there - need to ensure there is enough bite (spice) to it.<br />
Thanks for posting.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Two years ago, I found this receipt while at my sister's for Thanksgiving.  I was very happy with the outcome, but lost receipt.  Then, two years later, I found it again!  <br />
<br />
This receipt is like a Grandma's -- it never disappoints.  I double it every time I make pies, and it is always great.  I am currently baking my 8th and 9th pumpkin pies using this receipt.  They smell awesome, a great way to spend the night before Thanksgiving in Colorado!</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Year after year, I try pumpkin pie recipes hoping to find "THE ONE"... now, thanks to CFE's Pumpkin Pie recipe, I have found it!!!! It has just the perfect balance of sweetness and spice. I love the consistency too, not too dense and  not watery. The one small thing I would change is that I would use LIGHT brown sugar not dark because the color of the filling is more "pumpkin-y", the dark sugar makes the filling look too brown. (Just an aesthetic tweak.) I have to say that I converted two pumpkin pie haters with this recipe! Definitely give it a try, you can't go wrong! Thanks, Michael!</div>

					<div class="commentbody">reading the article or receipe on this site for the pumpkin pie. They say to do a egg wash on crust before you bake it,to prevent a soggy crust. If you just docked it wouldnt the egg wash clog the holes and not let the pie steam?</div>

					<div class="commentbody">the directions of Msg #1 call for docking / using weights and pre-bake / blind baking the crust.  the original does not suggest the egg wash.<br />
<br />
it is however not uncommon to egg wash the crust - aim is to keep it crisper.<br />
<br />
I've done all of the above in many different combinations but have not had the issue of an egg wash 'clogging' holes and defeating the docking purpose.<br />
<br />
in theory yes, the egg wash could do that - perhaps the steam is generated fast enough it blows the dock holes open before the egg has a chance to set?</div>

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>whole pumpkin</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">I made this pie using a whole cooking pumpkin i bought at the farmer's market. I cut the pumpkin into pieces, scooped out the seeds and strings and baked the pieces in a casserole dish covered in foil until the flesh can easily be pierced with a fork. Once it was cool I pressed it through a potato ricer. The first squeeze yields only liquid, which I separated to prevent the filling from being too wet. It turned out really well, but so much extra work, I think I'll stick with the canned pumpkin next time.</div>
