			Ordering New England Style Clam Chowder at a restaurant is an irresistible temptation for me. I always have to try it because everyone makes it a little different. My most common complaint is the lack of clams in many restaurant clam chowders, so I prepare my own whenever I have some extra cream on hand. My recipe balances the generous portion of clams with a satisfying amount of potatoes and clam juice to provide a briny flavor to this cream-based chowder. Steamed fresh clams can replace the canned clams if you have time or want to bring this recipe to the next level.<span class="fullpost"><?if($fullpost==1){?><br />
<br />
There are countless varieties of clam chowder - the most popular of which are called <i>New England Style</i> and <i>Manhattan Style</i>. The label New England Style has come to mean that the chowder has a cream or dairy base while Manhattan Style refers to a tomato base. A brief Google search reveals that the terms <i>Maine style</i> (heavy cream), <i>Rhode Island style</i> (light cream / soupy), <i>Oregon style</i> (extremely thick), <i>Yorktown style</i> (containing beer or ale), and <i>Southern style</i> (more vegetables and spices with some Worcestershire sauce) are also used - but I have yet to see them served in a restaurant. Of course, some restaurants' New England Style clam chowders seem to fit the description of Oregon or Rhode Island style.<br />

	Classic New England Style Clam Chowder begins with salt pork, but since I live in California, I've started with the West Coast classic: bacon (this time in the form of bacon grease). But first, let's take a look at what other ingredients we'll need.<br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4655_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4655_crop.jpg'  width='273' height='320' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Begin with one pound of diced russet potatoes (about one large potato) and 1/2 cup onion (about 1/2 medium onion). You'll also need a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and two tablespoons of bacon grease.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4656_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4656_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='171' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Drain the clams from two 10-ounce cans of clams (preferably canned in water, salt water, or broth - not oil). After draining, both cans should yield about a total of 10 ounces of clam meat. Also, prepare 8 ounces of clam juice. The flavor is better if you use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0004M1BYS/ref%3Dnosim/themichaelupdate">bottled clam juice</a> instead of the liquid the clams are packaged in, but if clam juice is unavailable, reserve 8 ounces of the liquid from the cans.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4658_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4658_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Heat two tablespoons of bacon grease and saute the onions in the hot grease until translucent, but not browned. Bacon grease can be collected and stored after you cook bacon. If you don't have any bacon grease in your refrigerator, go ahead and cook about four slices of bacon in the pan and remove the bacon and any excess bacon grease (remember to store it for future use) before sauteing the onions.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4660_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4660_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Add the diced potatoes and saute until all the potato has been coated by the fat. Throw in the tablespoon of flour and saute until the potatoes and onions have been coated.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4661_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4661_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Pour in the cup of clam juice and bring to a boil while stirring. Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat so it just simmers with the lid on. Cook with the lid on for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4662_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4662_crop.jpg'  width='212' height='320' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Prepare a mixture of one cup whole milk and one cup heavy cream. Half-and-half will also work as long as it's on the creamier side - if not, augmentation with some heavy cream may be necessary. The amount of fat is important for the texture of the chowder. Using only milk will result in a slightly thickened (due to the potato starch) watery consistency. Using only heavy cream will result in a really smooth, but much too rich chowder. The milk and cream mixture results in a cream fat concentration around 20%, producing what I think is the perfect consistency when served hot or warm. Using combinations of milk and cream to achieve this fat ratio helps us get to our desired consistency target. For example, some light whipping cream (about 18-30% fat content) has a fat content as low as 18%, so using straight light whipping cream of this type will provide us the desired amount of fat.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4663_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4663_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Once the potato, onion, and clam juice mixture has simmered for 20 minutes, stir to redistribute the solids.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4664_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4664_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Add the drained clams, milk, and cream.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4665_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4665_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='212' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Stir and heat through until hot, but not boiling. (Boiling may cause some of the milks solids to clump - but with 20% fat concentration this is less of a problem than if we were using straight milk. At around 30% or more fat, there is enough fat to prevent the clumping of the milk solids even while boiling.) While heating, this is right time to season with salt and pepper. Add salt a pinch at a time, stir, and taste. Repeat until you get the desired saltiness. It is important not to forget to add the salt and pepper - even though we have a lot of flavors in the chowder at this point, they will be muted without adding enough salt.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4848_crop.jpg'><img itemprop="photo" border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4848_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='303' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Serve while hot. I like garnishing with a bit of fresh chopped parsley and some bacon pieces.<?}?></span><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br />

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>Roux first?</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">Well, the roux first method does work well, but I can't taste the difference in clam chowder (as opposed to, let's say, gumbo where the roux reaches a brick color). Not producing real roux makes this recipe easy to do in one pot. In the roux first method, the potatoes can't easily be cooked in the bechamel without causing the dairy to clump - too much heat for too long. So, you cook the potatoes separate. But then what you end up with is:<br />
<br />
1. Precook potatoes in water, drain.<br />
2. Lightly saute onions in grease, remove from pot.<br />
3. Add flour to grease to form roux, cook.<br />
4. Add cream/milk and clam juice and bring to simmer<br />
5. Add precooked potatoes, onions, and clams<br />
6. Heat through, season, serve.<br />
<br />
Simple enough, but cooking the potatoes and onions separate is just an unnecessary step and uses multiple pots (unless you are cooking the chowder in your potato boiling pot -- which means an extra rinsing step and you'll be using a much larger pot for the chowder).<br />
<br />
However, it should be mentioned that if you are using pure heavy cream, you can probably cook the potatoes in that without worrying about curds forming because of the higher fat content. The only problem I have with that, is that it's a bit too rich for me.</div>

Too busy with the kid's basketball tournament in LA this weekend, but I will definitely give this recipe a try soon!<br />

Have you considered putting the approximate number of servings on your recipes?  I am having a tough time figureing out how many people could be served with one batch of chowda.<br />

Yes and no. A sweat is always performed over low heat with the intention of cooking the substance in their own juices (that will flow out and collect as they heat). Often, you'll press foil down onto the ingredients to help retain the moisture as they heat.  Sometimes, the term sweat is used loosely for whenever you wish to heat aromatics without browning, but in reality - it's often just a quick saute that's performed. Generally, I consider that if juices collect, then it's sweating - if it's still relatively dry, you're sauteing.<br />
<br />
In this recipe, we're cooking the onions just a bit to soften them up for their soak in the clam juice where they will liquify. We're not actually trying to sweat them out in this recipe.<br />

					<div class="commentbody">It seems to me that cooking the roux with the  potatoes is equivalent to the "roux first" method,  because the purpose of cooking the roux first is met, namely, you are incorporating the flour with the fat first, before liquids are added. If you toss the potatoes coated with flour around in butter or bacon grease, you also cook the flour to some degree.  (Cooking it longer in this state "toasts" the flour and should give a browner roux.)  <br />
<br />
When the liquid is finally added, the sauce will not be lumpy or taste like raw flour.  For some reason, if you can actually get the flour to mix directly with a water-based liquid, it still never really toasts up and tastes right.  <br />
<br />
The important criteria that are behind the "roux first" rule are met, as long as the potatoes aren't too watery, so I would vote to keep the recipe as it stands.</div>

If you are adding the cream/milk mixture to the roux, you probably don't want to boil in case anything splits.  You'd have to add the clam juice,boil to get the thickening, then add the cream/milk.  Other possibilites include using arrowroot as a thickener, which will thicken at a lower temperature.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I have always thought of the differences between Manhattan style and New England style to revolve around the kind of soup base.  Manhattan style is usually seen with a tomato base and no cream, thus creating a kind of vegetable soup with clams.  The Rhode Island clam chowder recipe I have from James Beard/Fannie Farmer involves both a fifty-fifty mix of cream and milk and also tomatoes.<br />
<br />
I think the reason chowder is usually served on Fridays comes from an old Roman Catholic tradition of having only fish on Fridays.  Many RCs were poor (long ago) and to help out the starving masses, there was a papal decree that only fish and seafood should be served on Fridays because of its low price and freshness.  This ended long ago, but the tradition still remains, as seen in some older practitioners and on our menus.</div>

A lot of factors come into play to control thickness. Increasing the flour will help, but to ensure that their is no raw flour taste, I would probably recommend cooking the flour in butter <i>first</i> to form a roux. Witht he small amounts of flour we used in this recipe, the cooking stage with the potatoes was enough to cook the flour, but with more flour, it's probably better safe than sorry. Don't overcook the roux because as it gains flavor it will lose thickening power.<br />
<br />
Next, make sure you use starchy potatoes like russets. Add them to the pot after ocoking without additional rinsing that that will ensure that all the potato starch gets into the chowder.<br />
<br />
After simmering the potatoes in clam juice, you can check to see how much liquid is left in the pot. If it's quite a bit, just continue to simmer until  most of the liquid is gone. This will produce a thicker chowder as well.<br />
<br />
Using only heavy cream will also make a thicker soup. <br />
<br />
How these tips will help you achieve the thickness that you're looking for.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">All this debate about how to prepare the roux is silly - New England clam chowder should NOT be thickened with roux.  Roux thickening is an ill-advised "innovation" introduced in the 1950s and popularized by HoJo's.  Truly traditional chowder (at least since potatoes replaced pounded seabiscuit ~150 years ago) is thickened by simmering the potatoes until they contribute some starchiness.  It is also thinner (I would say less glue-like) than what you get at most restaurants these days.<br />
<br />
I actually prefer canned chopped (not minced) sea clams to whole canned clams, but I'll take quahogs in the shell over any of the above.  If you heat the milk gently (just until warm) before you add it to the chowder, it won't separate.<br />

					<div class="commentbody">This site appeals to me because my software engineer son in Austin cooks like you do.  Before he made cookies at Christmas, he power-cleaned my KitchenAid until it looked brand-new.  As a Catholic, I must chime in to refute the nonsense posted about why we eat fish on Fridays.  The real reason, which goes back centuries, is to make a penance on the day Christ was crucified - Friday.  Giving up the usual meat dinner leaves the family with the alternative of fasting (eating less than usual - giving up something good as compensation for our sins) or eating something else in place of meat ( chicken and broths made from meat or chicken are also out).  Fish is an obvious non-meat choice.  The fact that the Christian symbol from 2 millenia back is a stylized fish may indicate this penance has been going on for that long.  Incidentally, this prohibition against meat on all Fridays is still in effect though in the past few decades the choice to eat meat and make another sort of penance on Fridays is possible.  Practicing Catholics must still abstain from meat on all Fridays during Lent.  Thanks for your efforts at exactitude.  Nan</div>

<br />
The Catholic Church, as well as most of the various Orthodox Christian churches, still have prohibitions regarding meat on Fridays, as a sacrifice symbolic of that on Good Friday. Western Catholic tradition holds that its members from ages of at least 14-65 should abstain from eating "flesh or fowl" on Fridays. The Greek Orthodox church, if I recall correctly, asks its members to abstain from eating vertebrates. <br />
<br />
This is for Fridays year round, not just in Lent.<br />
<br />
Different conferences of bishops may redefine the specifics of the fast. For instance, the United States Council of Catholic Bishops decreed in the 50's that Catholics in the US must abstain from meat, or make some other penitential act. <br />
<br />
Thus, few actually follow this directive today, but the custom still stands. The cafeteria at my workplace offers seafood dishes typically on Friday only.</div>

I hail from Maine, where the chowder is what keeps us going all winter long, and I must say cookbooks ALWAYS get maine chodwer wrong!<br />
<br />
For the best results, boil your claims seperately, then shuck and clean them....<br />
<br />
After, you use heavy cream and Maine Round White potatoes (Or california long whites if you can't get maine whites).  The white potatoes are also called All-Purpose potatoes. They have a medium startch content.<br />
<br />
Add your diced onions and taters (peeled or not, you're choice, I prefer them dirty) to the heavy cream, and some sugar to taste.  (Yep, I said sugar).  You don't want to bring this to a boil, instead it takes some active time to keep the temperature around 190 Degrees F.<br />
<br />
It takes about an hour to simmer, at about 45 minutes, the cream will be quite thick, and the potatoes nearly done.  So, add in your clams and then use the clam juice to thin out the cream.<br />
<br />
In liue of Salt pork, we actually tend to use Bacon.  You cut up as much bacon as you want in your chowder and let it cook with the potatoes etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is why resturaunt chowder sucks so much south of Maine....if you want the best chowder, make it yourself. Most resturaunts start with either canned clams or canned chowder, which tastes horribly bland.<br />
<br />
You can then garnish it with cracked or freshly ground pepper corn, and a few sprigs of parsely.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Best NE Clam Chowder I ever had was on a cold, typical day in Newport, RI. ( it was June and around 68 degrees, we were freezing) My husband said let's take our two kids and go on the wharf and eat in one of those dive places that locals go to.  Sure enough, we wnet in and had clam chowder, the best we ever had.  Our son, who was 8 at the time, ate at least 3 bowls of it.  Coming from Nashville, he had never had real clam chowder before.

You don't use a Roux.  Just try out salt port in the pot on low heat so the fat won't brown.  Then add the potatoes, onions and clams.  Add butta and warm milk when you serve.  If this is cooked correctly, the potatoes will thicken the chowda just enough.  Of course you have to let this set for a day and then reheat.  Much better the second day or the third, if there's any  left. :D</div>

					<div class="commentbody">New England is indeed made up of six states - CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, VT - and nothing more.  I grew up in NY State but have lived in CT &amp; MA for 23 years, and it still bothers me that when I say I'm originally from NY people assume it's NY City.  It's a large state, there's way more to it than just Manhattan and the boroughs - the beauty of the Adirondacks, the lakes and rivers throughout Upstate NY, the list goes on.  Regardless, no part of NY City is considered part of New England; perhaps it's just wishful thinking on the part of Manhattanites that they be part of Red Sox Nation.<br />
<br />
As John posted above, the starch from the potatoes helps to thicken chowder.  This, as well as well-rounded flavor, is why the potatoes should not be boiled separately and then added to the chowder.  A flour and fat combo is a roux although in this recipe it's not prepared as a traditional roux.  Whichever way works best to achieve the result you personally prefer is the one you should use.  While it may not be "the" original New England version, the preparation as presented here is quite common in New England restaurants and home kitchens today.  <br />
<br />
It's not a great idea to freeze  chowder as both the dairy products and the potatoes will lose their integrity, and reheating will result in a significantly different texture and appearance.  Substituting parsnips or turnips for potatoes is not recommended because they are both much stronger flavors and would overwhelm the delicate flavor of the clams.<br />
<br />

					<div class="commentbody">You can make chower that can be frozen. The key is to not add the dairy (either the cream or the milk) before it is frozen. <br />
<br />
To make this Rhode Island chowda you need the following:<br />
<br />
Quahogs<br />
Potatoes<br />
Onions<br />
Bacon or Chirico<br />
salt n pepper<br />
Water<br />
Milk<br />
<br />
<br />
Take your quahogs, wash em with a brush, and put them in a big pot. Cover with water. Put on very low to medium heat to cook them just enough to open them up. <br />
<br />
While your clams are cooking dice either two slices of bacon or a small piece of chirico. Place this in a frying pan for 5 minutes then add your chopped onions. Cook together until the onions are soft and just beginning to brown. Remove from the fire.<br />
<br />
Take you quahogs and shuck them over a bowl. Chop em. Put them in the bowl with the juice that you have collected. <br />
<br />
At this point you have the onions and the clams cooked and your juice. Sometimes I use the water from cooking the quahogs , strain it to remove any sand etc, then cook the potatoes with it.<br />
<br />
When the potatoes are half cooked add the rest of the items. Add salt and pepper to taste. At this point you have two choices. Continue and eat it. Or freeze it.<br />
<br />
Take some whole milk and being to whisk it into the chowder. Bring it to a boil and then remove it from the heat and serve right away. Garnish with a little dab of butter and paprika.<br />
<br />
Thats my story.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Any recipe, or how you choose to prepare it all boils down to one thing...personal preference.  I HATE, hearing people say, "no, no, no..." trying to tell people they are doing it all wrong,  just because they aren't fixing it they way they 'demand' you to.  Sheesh!  People are not all alike, and what one likes prepared one way,  the other may not like at all... So, you prepare it the way you like it and leave everyone else alone to decide for themselves which way is best for them.  Nobody is right, nobody is wrong...., fix it how it tastes the best to you and ignore all the nay sayers.  There are NO so-called food experts who can tell you what you like or don't like...it is all up to the individual and how it tastes to them.  No self-proclaimed food expert can decide that for you.  All the nit-picking going on about this recipe is ridiculous... People trying to tout their own horns.....grow up!  <br />
<br />
At any rate, we dug clams today, tried this recipe made with our fresh clams, and it was scrumptious...all nine of us who ate it agreed! That is all that matters, how it tastes to you.  If you don't like it, go post your recipe on your own site and let people decide for themselves.  <br />

not sure the New England style needs a lot of "flavor melding" time - as opposed to the Manhattan style which needs to extract/blend the leafy herbs and vegetable.<br />
<br />
I should think a hour, perhaps two is max. benefit.  depending on the potato you use (hi/lo starch, there's a debate...) making it too far ahead and holding it could result in unintentional thickening as a starchy potato breaks down.</div>

in a home kitchen, you'll probably use something like a stock pot.  the problem with one huge batch is a small heating area (the pot bottom) to a tall volume.  even with stirring I would not expect an even heating throughout the pot - given it's a something viscous mix.<br />

After buying a few cans of clams and tasting one, I decided that I like clams and would continue on to make the recipe.  I used bottled clam juice instead of the stuff in the cans.<br />
<br />
However, the result didn't impress me.  I added salt to taste but it's kind of bland and I had to give it a quick pulse with my immersion blender to thicken it up a little.  After chucking in a hunk of butter, the flavour improved tremendously, but it's still not that impressive.  I hope my boyfriend likes it better than me.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for butter.</div>

<br />
well, clam chowder is all about the clams - it is not a rip-out-yo-taste-buds savory type dish.  not sure I would describe "clam" as a 'delicate' flavor, but it's not in the same class as say pepperoni.<br />
<br />
as to some specific questions, bottled juice vs canned - not an issue.  if it is an issue it is the brand of juice being more or less 'better' - not can vs bottle<br />
<br />
thickening:  most of that comes from the potatoes; minor amount from the heavy cream reduction.  a high starch potato type is best - and even that depends on variety and how cooked they are - slightly overcooked will give you some "freely available starch"  a waxy type potato will not provide much thickening at all.  regardless, a quick pass with the boat motor is entirely in order.<br />
<br />
if you have the option, supermarket shelves being what they are, check out different brand names of clams and juice.  they do vary.  and if you have the availability - fresh clams will certainly set your taste buds in motion - steam them until they just open, scoop out the goodies, save the steaming juice for the chowder.  there be clams, and then there be _clams_!</div>

<br />
I should clarify - by "stuff in the cans" I meant the juice that was packed with the clams, which isn't clam juice at all but rather water that has had the clams soaking in it.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how to choose a high-starch potato - where I live, they are divided into "Yellow flesh", "White" and "Red" potatoes.  I like the yellow flesh because the flavour.  Though I'm not sure what kind of potato it is, or any of the other ones.<br />
<br />
The yellow flesh potatoes are somewhat more yellow inside than the white potatoes, though they look about the same on the outside.  The skins are very thin and I never remove them.  The only difference between the white and red potatoes seem to be the skin (they could have others but I have never noticed them).<br />
<br />
I don't live in an area where fresh seafood is readily available, and even then, I don't think I'd have time to go through shucking all the clams I'd need for a recipe such as this!  Nor carrying them home from the supermarket... can't imagine what a gigantic bag I'd need to carry them all.</div>

white potatoes are often called "all purpose" - they range in the middle regarding starch<br />
<br />
reds, fingerlings, yukons are low starch.<br />
<br />
juice from the clam can - that works!&lt;g&gt;<br />

					<div class="commentbody">This recipe was great! It was not much of a hassle for a beginner like me. I was little generous on the salt though. So my clam chowder was a tad too salty but the taste of the clams and thickness of the chowder was fine. <br />
<br />
The guideline on having 18%-30% fat content was a good gauge. I used approximately 230 ml of cream (20% fat) and 200 of milk (low fat though). I was quite worried that the texture might not turn out well. But it was great!<br />
<br />
Thank you for your recipe and I am glad my first attempt at clam chowder was a good one! :)</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I have been making/eating NE Clam Chowder for over 65 years and never in my life have I heard so many undesirable comments as to what it consists of.  Especially the adding dill, parsnips, garlic, and whatever other fancy someone adds.<br />
First off, NE CC. is started with Salt Pork (for the flavor) and for the fat to cook the onion in.<br />
I use, as did my Mother and her Mother before her, Soft Shelled, Quahogs, Sea Clams or the like.<br />
Use clam juice or save the clam broth from steamers the night before.<br />
Do the usual sauteing of the onion, then add the diced potatoes and lastly the clams. However, and this is the real kicker: we always used evaporated milk in our NE Chowder.  Top it all off with some cream  (usually this was from the top of the milk bottle in the old days). Sprinkle some paprika on top with a generous pat of butter and put in the refrigerator until the next day.  This affords the chowder to take on all the luscious flavors.<br />

					<div class="commentbody">Ok kids, I've worked in New England on a couple of occasions and loved the chowder on cold days. Being from Texas you won't find Chowder here unless it's out of a can. Here's a different twist on the classic. First I cook 1 pound of bacon till it's almost crisp. I drop in 1 Texas 1015 onion(super sweet about the size of a softball) into the bacon (never said it was heart healthy) and clarify the the onions. All you purist look away now as I drop in 6 cloves of chopped garlic. Drop in 6 small cans of minced clams with juice and continue(no fresh clams in Texas). I generally use 3 or 4 Russet potatos in about 1/2" cube cut (depends on how many kids are around). You may need to add just enough water to cover the potatos and keep going. Now the really gonna catch hell part. Take 1 whole package of Philly Cream Cheese and drop it in pieces and stir. It will start melting down and the chowder will start coming together. Not done yet. Let the potatos soften (test with a fork) once soft add 1 pint of Half and Half. Add fresh parsley to suit and bring to a boil. If too watery adjust with corn starch slurry (1 tablespoon of corn starch to 1/2 tablespoon of water. Bring to boil and it will thicken. Add some fresh crusty bread and stand back. For a little different look try a couple of seeded and veined jalapenos diced really fine for a liitle heat. Enjoy</div>

<br />
Cream Cheese works great.  It adds really great thickening that holds up to freezing better.<br />
<br />
I like to begin with clarified butter to saute the onions and potatoes.  Salt pork is mild enough, but bacon can impart too much smoke flavor.<br />
<br />
Have to agree on adding thyme, along with a small amount of white pepper you will have a much more flavorful chowda.<br />
<br />
Finally, I use both russets and yukon golds.  The russets will help thicken and the yukon golds impart buttery creaminess.</div>

I realzie chowder is not a extremely potent flavor, but it had considerable less flavor than I was used to tasting in restaurants etc. <br />

<br />
a lot of the thickening potential comes from the potatoes - which are a variable - some break down more than others.  a high starch variety (like russets) is preferred - but even russets vary.  but it's not unheard of to tweak the consistency.<br />
<br />
also to think on - potatoes benefit from salt - brings out their flavor.  you might try a touch more next batch.<br />
<br />
past that it's pretty much all about the clams - if you can get live clams that's the best taste approach - I find the canned clam does lose a lot of its flavor.<br />
<br />
reducing the clam juice prior to adding is another 'clam it up' trick.<br />
<br />
I like to use a sharp yellow onion - a little bit of mild onion can get lost.  I probably use double the onion of this recipe.<br />
<br />
I also use chopped parsley or fresh chives stirred in and cooking end.<br />
<br />
personally I don't keep bacon fat around, so I fry up 4-5 slices to get the fat - done to crispy crisp state, the crumbled bacon goes on top just prior to service.<br />
<br />
if you want more fancy, finely diced hard boiled eggs is another nice 'floater' for presentation.</div>

Since Dustin implied he was new to cooking, I thought I'd clarify what Dilbert means by "reducing". He doesn't mean reducing the amount of clam juice used - in kitchen-speak "reducing" means to concentrate by way of boiling/simmering. The volume is reduced, but the flavors are concentrated.</div>

clam juice is essentially the pot liquid from steaming clams - so indeed you can start with fresh clams!  <br />
<br />
I usually steam them with some onion / celery / salt - just strain out the solids and you've got 'instant' clam juice.  you can also reduce it very gently to help concentrate the flavor.<br />
<br />
working with canned clams usually does not produce enough liquid - hence the bottled clam juice booster.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Who said to shut up about where New England begins and ends?  Do you have a problem? Come over here and let's talk about it for a second.<br />
<br />
We here in New England love to argue about anything, and everything.  A very important things to us is our group identity, which is in part defined by our geography.  <br />
<br />
A prized characteristic here is to be honest to others.  That's why when you ask someone "How are you today?" they might respond with "Horrible, I'm just having one hell of a day." Think I'm lying? Look at the Boston Herald comments about the Red Sox.  We're a bitter and angry group of people.  And when people make mistakes about us, we care, and we love to point out flaws.  Hence the voluminous response response to a tiny geographical error.<br />
<br />
I think if you are going to cook New England food, you might try on our emotional angst and bitterness while you're cooking.  Just for kicks!  Scowl the whole time you cook.<br />
<br />
Wikipedia is wrong.  Just for the record, here is how Bostonians define New England:<br />
<br />
NYC is not New England.  Half of Connecticut is not New England either; it is Suburban NYC or "The backyard" or the city.  Yankee fans too.<br />
<br />
All of Mass, Vermont, R.I., New Hampshire and Maine are in New England.  <br />
<br />
Many consider New Brunswick, PEI, and Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland to be a part of New England, but generally we term this group "Maritime States" because it's Canada, even though we do share "New England" cultural heritage with them.<br />
<br />
Quebec is Not New England; is is French Canadia.<br />
<br />
Secretly, we all wish NYC was a part of New England, but our angst gets in the way.  Probably the day we admit we like NY, we'll get annexed.</div>

I have been making a version of chowder for years that my family loves.<br />
I always make a huge potful because they eat it for breakfast and lunch the next day.<br />
<br />
Since our family rarely goes by breakfast conventions, it is rather sweet to see them eat and enjoy huge bowlsful of it the next day and ignore other food.<br />
<br />
What is a standby menu with the chowder is cornbread or a whole grain quick bread, and an apple crisp for dessert, no ice cream or whipped cream.</div>

First I did use bacon. and very thick lean and tasty type. Second I used fresh Razor clams I got my self. third I used two sprigs of garlic and several good shots of Tabasco sauce as my seasoning to taste<br />
On the making process I chopped the clams into very small pieces and cooked them separately in a pan with the garlic till not quite brown, draining off the juice into the the already cooking potatoes. Every thing else I did as your recipe asked.. <br />

					<div class="commentbody">A roux is an essential part of French cooking and is therefore an essential part of Cajun cooking.  This was adapted into southern cooking.  I repeat: <i>SOUTHERN</i> COOKING.  This is why a roux is not used in traditional New England clam chowder.  Nothing is to stop anyone from using a roux in clam chowder, but if a roux is used, don't consider what you have made to be <i>traditional</i> New England clam chowder.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I've made this soup twice now and it came out great both times. I love clam chowder and have been looking for a good recipe to try - and this is it. I think cooking in the bacon grease definitely adds flavor to the soup! Great recipe!</div>

					<div class="commentbody">For the person living in Paris, of course we have clams in Europe, in the UK they are known as cockles in French "praires" and in German "Venusmuschel". They are not the same varieties of clam as in the USA, i.e. no littlenecks or quahogs but they are in the clam family all the same and can be made into clam chowder. Cockles are usually sold minus the shell, the best place for cockles in the UK is in Wales,Swansea Market on a Wednesday, there are also delicious cockles in Morecambe Bay (where the Chinese cockle-pickers were killed by the rising tide).</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Well, i tried to follow the recipie best i could except for the portions. This is a dish my wife allways orders when she gets the chance so thought i'd take a crack at it. I started from the bacon grease all the way down to the heavy cream and half and half. Stuffed it in the middle with plenty of minced clams and whole baby ones. Ohh yeah, I went for broke and just for good measure added some chopped mushrooms. I got carried away and ended up with a big pot. I added some Rock sea salt and black pepper, stired it well. stuck a spoon in it and tasted. Damn that is good. Blew my mind if i do say so myself. You boys sure know your stuff up in here and im grateful. Man, i mean this stuff rivals any i've had anywhere! Thanks again for teaching me how to make this dish.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">... just everything x6<br />
<br />
bottom line yes, recipes are usually flexible to minor changes in proportions  _except_ <br />
<br />
seasonings - some are "stronger" than others and less than x6 will work - a minor "generality" in this case as the recipe is just salt&amp;pepper<br />
<br />
"thickening" - one single huge pot is is going to cook differently - in particular the amount of starch coming out of the potatoes - so don't put in all the x6 liquids at one crack - hold off to see how it thickens up and be prepared to add more or less liquid than the x6 math indicates.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Since this is a "stew", the recipe is quite "forgiving".  Nonetheless I made this chowder once, sticking closely to the recipe EXCEPT that I used diced white baby potatoes with skin-on, and was thrilled.<br />
<br />
Using Fresh clams:<br />
<br />
Today I made an over-sized recipe with 2 dozen clams ranging from "Cherrystone" to large "Quahog" size, and it is again marvelous.  Washed, then soaked the raw clams in water with corn starch and salt, then rinsed them again.  Steamed the clams open, saved the broth (let the sand settle out) and used this instead of bottled clam juice.  Same as before using baby white skin-on spuds.  Wow-ee.<br />
<br />
With fresh clams (and no food processor nearby for chopping - lost it in Hurricane Irene and haven't replaced it yet) it's quite a bit more time-consuming, but I'm not complaining - it was worth it!<br />
<br />
We are all um... happy as a clam here.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!!<br />

					<div class="commentbody">So we tried your Clam Chowder tonight and it was FANTASTIC! I had three tins of clams left that my mom shipped over to the UK for me (you can't get them here) and I needed to use them up before we move back to NH. It went down a treat! The only thing I added was a can of creamed corn because that's how I remember my mom's. Thanks for the fantastic memory!</div>
